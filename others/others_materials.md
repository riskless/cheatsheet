### Data Structures
- A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.
- We talk about data structures as:
	1. Mathematical/logical models or Abstract data types (ADT)
	1. Implementation
- Abstract data types: Define data and operations, but no implementation.
- List (ADT)
	- Store a given number of elements of any type
 	- Specify data type
  	- Read elements at a position
  	- Write/Modify element at a position
	- Remove
	- Eempty list has size 0
	- Count
  	- Concret Implementation: Arrays, Linked List, etc.
### Arrays
- Cost of operations
	- Access: constant time, O(1)

### Linked list
- head: address of the head node gives us access of the complete list
- Cost of operations
	- Access to elements: O(n)
	- Insertion: O(n)
	- Delete: O(n)
