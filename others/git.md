### ABOUT GIT
- Git is a version control tool that saves changes to groups of files so you can revert back if needed.
- There are different types of version control tools
	- Local Version Control saves changes to files in a database
	- Centralized Version Control saves changes to a shared server
	- Distributed Version Control allows for easier sharing of files than LVC and also eliminates problems that could occur if access to the server is lost under a CVC system.
	- DVC clients have a complete backup of the files on their computer. If the server is lost the client just waits to regain contact and then uploads changes.
- When you commit changes to files, Git stores a reference of what the files look like at that moment. If a file isn't changed it isn't stored again.
- Each client has a complete history of all changes stored locally. The client can also access all changes made to the files historically with a simple command. Also those files cannot be changed without Git knowing and changes are difficult to lose.
- Files transition between 3 states with Git
	- Modified Files are files that have been recently changed
	- Staged Files have been marked to be saved
	- Committed Files are those that have been saved
- Git saves all file changes to a directory as a compressed database. 
	- You modify files in Working Directory
	- You notify that want to save changes in your Staging Area
	- After you Commit the file changes are saved in the Git directory
