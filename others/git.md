### ABOUT GIT
- Git is a version control tool that saves changes to groups of files so you can revert back if needed.
- There are different types of version control tools
	- Local Version Control saves changes to files in a database
	- Centralized Version Control saves changes to a shared server
	- Distributed Version Control allows for easier sharing of files than LVC and also eliminates problems that could occur if access to the server is lost under a CVC system.
	- DVC clients have a complete backup of the files on their computer. If the server is lost the client just waits to regain contact and then uploads changes.
- When you commit changes to files, Git stores a reference of what the files look like at that moment. If a file isn't changed it isn't stored again.
- Each client has a complete history of all changes stored locally. The client can also access all changes made to the files historically with a simple command. Also those files cannot be changed without Git knowing and changes are difficult to lose.
- Files transition between 3 states with Git
	- Modified Files are files that have been recently changed
	- Staged Files have been marked to be saved
	- Committed Files are those that have been saved
- Git saves all file changes to a directory as a compressed database. 
	- You modify files in Working Directory
	- You notify that want to save changes in your Staging Area
	- After you Commit the file changes are saved in the Git directory

### USING GIT
- git config --global user.name "Derek Banas" 
- git config --global user.email derekbanas@verizon.net
- git config --global core.editor "vim" # Set editor as vim

- Track a directory
	- Go to directory
	- ls -a shows all files
	- git init # Creates the .git directory
- Start tracking files
	- By type : git add *.java
	- By name : git add AndroidManifest.xml
- Ignore Files
	- Create a .gitignore file
	- https://github.com/github/gitignore
- git commit -m 'Initial project version' 
	- Commits the changes and sets an abbreviated commit message
- git status
	- Shows the state of your files meaning if they are tracked, have been modified and the branch your on.
- Stage A Modified File
	- Change the file and save
	- git diff # Shows what you changed, but haven't staged
	- git add AndroidManifest.xml # Stage file
	- git diff --cached # Shows what has been staged, but not committed 
- Commit The Changes
	- commit # Opens the editor we defined above or vi
	- In vi click [ESC] i to enter insert mode
	- Type a heading that briefly explains the changes in 50 characters or less
	- Describes the original problem that is being addressed
	- Describes the specific change being made
	- Describes the result of the change
	- Describes any future improvements
	- Post a closes bug notation Closes-Bug: #1291621
	- Hit [ESC] and type wq to save and exit
	- git commit -a -m 'Changed comment' # Skips staging and commit message
- Remove a File
	- rm DeleteMe.txt # If you remove a file it shows as "Changed but not updated"
	- git status # If you remove a file it shows as "Changed but not updated"
	- git rm DeleteMe.txt
	- git status # Shows that the file was deleted
	- If you have committed a file to be removed you must add the -f option
	- git rm --cached DeleteMe.txt # Keep file, but remove from staging area
	- git mv DeleteMe.txt Delete.txt # Renames a file
- Log Commit History
	- git log # Shows all of the previous commit messages in reverse order

	- git log --since="2014-04-12" # Show changes since this date
	- git log --author="Derek Banas" # Changes made by author
	- git log --before="2014-04-13" # Changes made before this date
- Undoing a Commit
	- git commit --amend # If you want to change your previous commit
	- Normally done if you forgot to stage a file, or to change the commit message
- Unstage a File
	- git reset HEAD AndroidManifest.xml

### GitHub, Remote Repositories, Push, Pull, Remote, Fetch, Tagging, Aliases and Clone
- GitHub allows you to host your code repositories online.
- Remote repositories are normally read only, or read write only to those who are authorized 
- You either push or pull updates from these remote repositories.
- To push your directory to GitHub 
	- git init
	- git add . # Stages all new and modified files and directories
	- git commit -m 'Initial Project Version'
	- git remote add origin https://github.com/riskless/cheatsheet.git
	- git push origin main
- git remote -v # Lists all remotes and their URLs
- git fetch origin # Gets data from the remote, but it doesn't merge changes with your work
- git pull https://github.com/riskless/cheatsheet.git
	- Pulls all changes and saves them to your directory
- How to push changes to GitHub
	- I add .gitignore for Android on my local machine
	- In the terminal type
		- git add .gitignore # Stage .gitignore
		- git commit -m 'Added .gitignore for Android' # Commit
		- git push # Push the changes to GitHub
- git remote rename origin sf # Renames remote to sf
- Tagging 
	- Tags are used to tag files at important points in history
	- git tag -a v0.1 -m 'version 0.1' # Creates an annotated tag
	- git tag # Shows all the tags
	- git show v0.1 # Shows details about the commit that was tagged
	- git tag v0.4-lw 
		- Creates a lightweight tag on a commit that stores the hash for the commit
	- git tag -a v0.01 c930a8
		I. You can tag commits after the event also. When you enter this command an editor opens for you to leave a comment. The final part is the hash for the commit you want to tag.
	- git push sf v0.1 # You can also push tags
		I. The tag shows up under releases on GitHub
		II. git push sf --tags # You can also push all tags at once
- You can set aliases to save time
	- git config --global alias.co commit
	- Now you can type git co to commit
- Clone a GitHub Repository
	- Go to the directory you want to use
	- git clone https://github.com/riskless/cheatsheet.git

### Branching, HEAD, Checkout, Rebasing, Reverting, Reset, Clean, Solving Merge Conflicts and Mergetool
- Branching allows you to take a project in your own direction without effecting the main code. You use them to make sure you don't introduce unstable code to the master branch.
- When you commit a project :
	- Each file is given a hash code
	- A tree object that contains those files and the associated hash codes receives a hash code
	- A commit object stores a reference to the tree and other data like the author, commit comment, a reference to the previous commit and other data.
- The default branch is called the master. As you make additional commits the current newest version is referred to as the master.
- If you create a branch you can go in a different direction with the project without effecting the master until you merge. Each branch creates a new pointer to a committed version of files and doesn't make another copy of the files.
- We can actually create many branches, but be careful while doing this because it can get to be hard to merge multiple branches. A pointer known as HEAD can be pointed at any committed version or to any branch with the checkout command.
- When you are finished with your branch you can merge back into the master commit and move on. You can also do all of this locally or on a remote.
- Simple Branch Example
	- git checkout -b fix20 # Create a branch and switch to it
		- Same as :
			- git branch fix20
			- git checkout fix20
	- Change AndroidManifest.xml in vim
	- git commit -a -m 'Added Branch fix20' # Commit the change to the branch, but not to master
	- git checkout master # Switch to master 
	- git push origin fix20 # Push the branch to GitHub
	- git fetch origin # If someone else fetches from the server they get a reference to the branch on the server but not all the files
	- git checkout -b fix20 origin/fix20 # Retrieves the branch fix20
	- git branch # Shows all branches
	- git branch --merged # Shows all merged branches
	- git branch --no-merged # Shows unmerged branches
	- git branch -v 
		- Shows all branches and their last commits
		- * Points out the branch currently checked out
	- git merge fix20 # Merge the branch version with the master
		- git push # Push the change to GitHub
	- git branch -d fix20 # You can delete merged branches with this
	- git branch -D fix22 # Deletes unmerged branches
	- git push origin :fix20 # Deletes the branch on GitHub
	- git branch -m newBranchName # Renames a branch
- Multiple Branch Example
	- git checkout -b fix21 # Create a branch and switch to it
	- Edit AndroidManifest.xml
	- git commit -a -m 'Added Branch fix21'
	- git checkout master # Switch to master 
	- Look at Manifest to see that nothing changed
	- git checkout -b 'hotfix' # Create a new branch
	- git commit -a -m 'Added Hot Fix' # Commit the Hot Fix
	- git checkout master # Switch to master
	- git merge hotfix # Merge the hotfix version with the master
	- git branch -d hotfix # Delete the hotfix branch
	- git checkout fix21 # Switch to fix21 branch
	- git checkout master # Make sure you are in master
	- git merge fix21 # Merges the branch and master if there are no conflicts
	- If there is a conflict resolve it
	- git branch -d fix21 # Delete the unneeded branch
		- git branch -D fix21 # To force delete
	- git mergetool # You can merge with a graphical tool
		- Backup : Contents of the file before calling the merge tool
		- Base : The common ancestor of the files being merged
		- Local : Version being pointed at by HEAD
		- Remote : The branch being merged into head
- Rebasing Example
	- Rebasing moves a branch to a new ( master / base ) commit. This is also referred to as a fast forward merge. Just never rebase commits that have been pushed to a public repository
	- git checkout -b fix22
	- Edit AndroidManifest.xml
	- git commit -a -m 'Changed the comment to 10'
	- git checkout -b hotfix
	- Edit another file other then AndroidManifest
	- git commit -a -m 'Edited file....'
	- git checkout master
	- git merge hotfix
	- git branch -d hotfix
	- git checkout fix22
	- git rebase master # Move branch to new master commit
	- git checkout master
	- git merge fix22
- Reverting Vs. Resetting Example
	- Some times you want to eliminate a previous commit, but you still want to keep the commit for integrity reasons. Revert undoes changes made in that commit and makes a new commit. Reset actually deletes the commit which can cause problems.
	- Do something that will be undone
	- git commit -m 'Made a change that I will undo'
	- git revert HEAD # You are back to where you started, but the commit was made
	- Reset eliminates previous commits and you can never get them back. You really should never use it actually.
	- git reset someFile # Removes a file from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged
	- git reset # Reset the staging area to match the most recent commit while leaving the working directory unchanged
	- git reset aCommit # Move back to this previous commit, reseting the staging area, but not the working directory
	- git reset --hard # Reset both the staging area and working directory to match the most recent commit
	- git reset --hard aCommit # Move back to the commit listed and change staging and working directory
- Clean Example
	- Clean removes untracked files from your directory and is undoable.
	- git clean -n # Shows which files will be removed
	- git clean -f # Remove untracked files
	- git clean -df # Remove untracked files and untracked directories in the current directory
	- git reset --hard # Undoes changes on all tracked files
